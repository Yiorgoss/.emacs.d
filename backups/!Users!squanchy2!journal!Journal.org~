* Random Thoughts
* Journal
** July 4th 2019
   The time has come for me to be the best possible version of
   myself. No more fucking about, no more acceptance of mediocrity. I
   refuse to be the average, the mean.
   
   The motivation for this desire comes fromm a number of
   sources. First and foremost, thhe need to be better. I have never
   been content with acceptable, adequate or any other such
   synonym. Ant yet I have been exactly life. Due in part to my
   upbringing and personality, in which I have no doubt I will expand
   in some future entry, due mostly however to my
   intelligence, or lack thereof as we will coomeee too see

   While I am starting this journal in part to help clear my mind, and make
   my thoughts mose concise, I am doing this to have practice onn my
   kuyboard, since switching llayouts has proven more difficult to
   adapt to than I had originally expected. Thus this wyll have to
   serve as both therapy and practice.
   
   Right now I am aware that I must chakgee and for thee better. Below
   are the changes I will be implementing.

[1] Gym every weekday.
[2] Won Hoof every day.
[3] One hour on hackerrank a day.
[4] Journal entry every day.
[5] No more masturbation
